Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but \nwithin myself to the choices that are my own...” \n—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.5.4-5 \nhe single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change \nand what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of \nweather—no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will \nmake you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make \nsomeone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not \nspent on the things we can change. \nThe recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity \nto accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the \ndifference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they \nhave made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future—through the power they have in \nthe present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now. \nThe same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our \ncontrol and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other \npeople who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.\n", "1": "\n  \nJanuary 2nd \nEDUCATION IS FREEDOM \n  \n“What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly \neducated—tranquility, fearlessness, and freedom.

Why pick up any book? Not to seem smarter, not to pass time on the \nplane, not to hear what you want to hear—there are plenty of easier choices than reading. \nNo, you picked up this book because you are learning how to live. Because you want to be freer, fear \nless, and achieve a state of peace. Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is \nnot to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose. \nRemember that imperative on the days you start to feel distracted, when watching television or having \na snack seems like a better use of your time than reading or studying philosophy.

You will realize you are dying before your time!” \n—SENECA, ON THE BREVITY OF LIFE, 3.3b \n() ne of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to requests, to obligations, to the \nstuff that everyone else is doing. Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: \nanger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. None of these impulses feels like a big deal by itself, but \nrun amok, they become a commitment like anything else. \nIf you’re not careful, these are precisely the impositions that will overwhelm and consume your life. \nDo you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by \nlearning the power of “No!”—as in “No, thank you,” and “No, I’m not going to get caught up in that,” and \n“No, I just can’t right now.” It may hurt some feelings. It may turn people off. It may take some hard \nwork.But the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. \nThis will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.\n", "3": "\n  \nJanuary 4th \nTHE BIG THREE \n“All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment; \naction for the common good in the present moment; \nand an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way.” \n—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 9.6 \nPp erception, Action, Will.

To the Stoics, oiésis (false conceptions) are \nresponsible not just for disturbances in the soul but for chaotic and dysfunctional lives and operations. \nWhen your efforts are not directed at a cause or a purpose, how will you know what to do day in and day \nout? How will you know what to say no to and what to say yes to? How will you know when you’ ve had \nenough, when you’ ve reached your goal, when you’ve gotten off track, if you’ve never defined what those \nthings are? \nThe answer is that you cannot.

Soon enough, these harmless habits are running our lives. \nThe little compulsions and drives we have not only chip away at our freedom and sovereignty, they \ncloud our clarity. We think we’re in control—but are we really? As one addict put it, addiction is when \nwe’ ve “lost the freedom to abstain.” Let us reclaim that freedom. \nWhat that addiction is for you can vary: Soda? Drugs? Complaining? Gossip? The Internet? Biting \nyour nails? But you must reclaim the ability to abstain because within it is your clarity and self-control.\n", "8": "\n  \nJanuary 9th \nWHAT WE CONTROL AND WHAT WE DON’T \n  \n“Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control our opinion, choice, desire, \naversion, and, in a word, everything of our own doing. We don’t control our body, property, \nreputation, position, and, in a word, everything not of our own doing. Even more, the things in \nour control are by nature free, unhindered, and unobstructed, while those not in our control are \nweak, slavish, can be hindered, and are not our own.” \n—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 1.1-2 \nTy oday, you won’t control the external events that happen. Is that scary? A little, but it’s balanced when \nwe see that we can control our opinion about those events. You decide whether they’re good or bad, \nwhether they’re fair or unfair. You don’t control the situation, but you control what you think about it. \nSee how that works? Every single thing that is outside your control—the outside world, other people, \nluck, karma, whatever—still presents a corresponding area that is in your control. This alone gives us \nplenty to manage, plenty of power. \nBest of all, an honest understanding of what is within our control provides real clarity about the \nworld: all we have is our own mind.

How do they accomplish this elusive goal? How does one embody \neustatheia (the word Arrian used to describe this teaching of Epictetus)? \nWell, it’s not luck. It’s not by eliminating outside influences or running away to quiet and solitude. \nInstead, it’s about filtering the outside world through the straightener of our judgment. That’s what our \nreason can do—it can take the crooked, confusing, and overwhelming nature of external events and make \nthem orderly. \nHowever, if our judgments are crooked because we don’t use reason, then everything that follows will \nbe crooked, and we will lose our ability to steady ourselves in the chaos and rush of life. If you want to \nbe steady, if you want clarity, proper judgment is the best way.\n", "10": "\n  \nJanuary 11th \nIF YOU WANT TO BE UNSTEADY \n  \n“For if a person shifts their caution to their own reasoned choices and the acts of those choices, \nthey will at the same time gain the will to avoid, but if they shift their caution away from their \nown reasoned choices to things not under their control, seeking to avoid what is controlled by \nothers, they will then be agitated, fearful, and unstable.” \n—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 2.1.12 \nhe image of the Zen philosopher is the monk up in the green, quiet hills, or in a beautiful temple on \nsome rocky cliff. The Stoics are the antithesis of this idea. Instead, they are the man in the \nmarketplace, the senator in the Forum, the brave wife waiting for her soldier to return from battle, the \nsculptor busy in her studio. Still, the Stoic is equally at peace. \nEpictetus is reminding you that serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your \nenvironment. If you seek to avoid all disruptions to tranquility—other people, external events, stress— \nyou will never be successful. Your problems will follow you wherever you run and hide.

This is the only thing that can never be taken from you \ncompletely. \nIn the afternoon, remind yourself that aside from the choices you make, your fate is not entirely up to \nyou.

According to the Stoics, \nthe circle of control contains just one thing: YOUR MIND. That’s right, even your physical body isn’t \ncompletely within the circle. After all, you could be struck with a physical illness or impairment at any \nmoment. You could be traveling in a foreign country and be thrown in jail. \nBut this is all good news because it drastically reduces the amount of things that you need to think \nabout.

But he knew plenty of distracting sinkholes too: gossip, the endless call of work, as well \nas fear, suspicion, lust.

That’s not to say we’re always going to be 100 percent \ncertain of everything, or that we even should be. Rather, it’s that we can rest assured we’re heading \ngenerally in the right direction—that we don’t need to constantly compare ourselves with other people or \nchange our mind every three seconds based on new information. \nInstead, tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in sticking to it: staying the course \n—making adjustments here and there, naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens who beckon us to turn \ntoward the rocks.\n", "15": "\n  \nJanuary 16th \nNEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT \n  \n“So in the majority of other things, we address circumstances not in accordance with the right \nassumptions, but mostly by following wretched habit.

It takes an artist’s eye to see that the end of life is not unlike a ripe fruit \nfalling from its tree.

He thanks, one by \none, the leading influences in his life. One of the people he thanks is Quintus Junius Rusticus, a \nteacher who developed in his student a love of deep clarity and understanding—a desire to not just stop at \nthe surface when it comes to learning. \nIt was also from Rusticus that Marcus was introduced to Epictetus. In fact, Rusticus loaned Marcus his \npersonal copy of Epictetus’s lectures. Marcus clearly wasn’t satisfied with just getting the gist of these \nlectures and didn’t simply accept them on his teacher’s recommendation. Paul Johnson once joked that \nEdmund Wilson read books “as though the author was on trial for his life.” That’s how Marcus read \nEpictetus—and when the lessons passed muster, he absorbed them. They became part of his DNA as a \nhuman being. He quoted them at length over the course of his life, finding real clarity and strength in \nwords, even amid the immense luxury and power he would come to possess. \nThat’s the kind of deep reading and study we need to cultivate as well, which is why we’re reading \njust one page a day instead of a chapter at a time.

If you hold this firmly, you’ ll stop trying to get yourself \nall the other things. . . . If you don’t, you won’t be free, self-sufficient, or liberated from passion, \nbut necessarily full of envy, jealousy, and suspicion for any who have the power to take them, \nand you’! plot against those who do have what you prize. .. . But by having some self-respect \nfor your own mind and prizing it, you will please yourself and be in better harmony with your \nfellow human beings, and more in tune with the gods—praising everything they have set in order \nand allotted you.” \n—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 6.16.2b-4a \nW aren Buffett, whose net worth is approximately $65 billion, lives in the same house he bought in \n1958 for $31,500.

San Antonio Spurs star Kawhi Leonard gets around in the 1997 Chevy Tahoe \nhe’s had since he was a teenager, even with a contract worth some $94 million. Why? It’s not because \nthese men are cheap. It’s because the things that matter to them are cheap. \nNeither Buffett nor Urschel nor Leonard ended up this way by accident. Their lifestyle is the result of \nprioritizing. They cultivate interests that are decidedly below their financial means, and as a result, any \nincome would allow them freedom to pursue the things they most care about. It just happens that they \nbecame wealthy beyond any expectation. This kind of clarity—about what they love most in the world— \nmeans they can enjoy their lives. It means they’d still be happy even if the markets were to turn or their \ncareers were cut short by injury. \nThe more things we desire and the more we have to do to earn or attain those achievements, the less \nwe actually enjoy our lives—and the less free we are.\n", "25": "\n  \nJanuary 26th \nTHE POWER OF A MANTRA \n  \n“Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul \nto keep out any evil, desire or any kind of disturbance—instead, seeing the true nature of things, \nI will give them only their due.

In Sanskrit, it means “sacred utterance”—essentially a word, a phrase, a \nthought, even a sound—intended to provide clarity or spiritual guidance. A mantra can be especially \nhelpful in the meditative process because it allows us to block out everything else while we focus. \nIt’s fitting, then, that Marcus Aurelius would suggest this Stoic mantra—a reminder or watch phrase to \nuse when we feel false impressions, distractions, or the crush of everyday life upon us. It says, \nessentially, “I have the power within me to keep that out. I can see the truth.” \nChange the wording as you like. That part is up to you.

The \nfirst has to do with desires and aversions—that a person may never miss the mark in desires nor \nfall into what repels them. The second has to do with impulses to act and not to act—and more \nbroadly, with duty—that a person may act deliberately for good reasons and not carelessly. The \nthird has to do with freedom from deception and composure and the whole area of judgment, the \nassent our mind gives to its perceptions. Of these areas, the chief and most urgent is the first \nwhich has to do with the passions, for strong emotions arise only when we fail in our desires \nand aversions.” \n—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 3.2.1-3a \nTy oday, let’s focus on the three areas of training that Epictetus laid out for us. \nFirst, we must consider what we should desire and what we should be averse to. Why? So that \nwe want what is good and avoid what is bad. It’s not enough to just listen to your body—because our \nattractions often lead us astray. \nNext, we must examine our impulses to act—that is, our motivations. Are we doing things for the right \nreasons? Or do we act because we haven’t stopped to think? Or do we believe that we have to do \nsomething? \nFinally, there is our judgment. Our ability to see things clearly and properly comes when we use our \ngreat gift from nature: reason. \nThese are three distinct areas of training, but in practice they are inextricably intertwined. Our \njudgment affects what we desire, our desires affect how we act, just as our judgment determines how we \nact. But we can’t just expect this to happen. We must put real thought and energy into each area of our \nlives. If we do, we’Il find real clarity and success.\n", "27": "\n  \nJanuary 28th \nWATCHING THE WISE \n  \n“Take a good hard look at people’s ruling principle, especially of the wise, what they run away \nfrom and what they seek out.” \n—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 4.38 \nS eneca has said, “Without a ruler to do it against, you can’t make crooked straight.” That is the role of \nwise people in our lives—to serve as model and inspiration. To bounce our ideas off and test our \npresumptions. \nWho that person will be for you is up to you. Perhaps it’s your father or your mother. Maybe it’s a \nphilosopher or a writer or a thinker.

Why do they deliberately say offensive and nasty things to \ntheir competitors when the refs aren’t looking? To provoke a reaction.

It’s weakness. Depending on what you’re doing, it might even be a trap that someone laid for \nyou. \nFans and opponents called boxer Joe Louis the “Ring Robot” because he was utterly unemotional—his \ncold, calm demeanor was far more terrifying than any crazed look or emotional outburst would have been. \nStrength is the ability to maintain a hold of oneself.

If there’s a plate of cookies in front of us, we have to eat them. If someone does something we \ndislike, we have to get mad about it. When something bad happens, we have to be sad, depressed, or \nworried. But if something good happens a few minutes later, all of a sudden we’re happy, excited, and \nwant more. \nWe would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our impulses do. It’s time we start \nseeing it that way—that we’re not puppets that can be made to dance this way or that way just because we \nfeel like it.

Getting worked up, getting excited, nervously pacing—these intense, pained, and \nanxious moments show us at our most futile and servile. Staring at the clock, at the ticker, at the next \ncheckout lane over, at the sky—it’s as if we all belong to a religious cult that believes the gods of fate \nwill only give us what we want if we sacrifice our peace of mind. \nToday, when you find yourself getting anxious, ask yourself: Why are my insides twisted into knots? \nAm I in control here or is my anxiety?

The \nmedia is waiting for them to slip up or get upset, so to successfully navigate press events they have \ninternalized the importance of keeping themselves under calm control. \nIt’s unlikely you’ ll face a horde of probing reporters bombarding you with insensitive questions today. \nBut it might be helpful—whatever stresses or frustrations or overload that do come your way—to picture \nthat image and use it as your model for dealing with them. Our reasoned choice—our prohairesis, as the \nStoics called it—is a kind of invincibility that we can cultivate. We can shrug off hostile attacks and \nbreeze through pressure or problems.

Like \ndreams, they are vivid and realistic at the time but preposterous once we come out of it. Ina dream, we \nnever stop to think and say: “Does this make any sense?” No, we go along with it. The same goes with our \nflights of anger or fear or other extreme emotions. \nGetting upset is like continuing the dream while you’re awake.

That green light that Gatsby \nstrove for can represent seemingly good things too, like love or a noble cause.

From what we can gather about the play, Bellerophon, \nthe hero, comes to doubt the existence of the gods. But in this line, he is saying: Why bother getting mad at \ncauses and forces far bigger than us? Why do we take these things personally? After all, external events \nare not sentient beings—they cannot respond to our shouts and cries—and neither can the mostly \nindifferent gods. \nThat’s what Marcus was reminding himself of here: circumstances are incapable of considering or \ncaring for your feelings, your anxiety, or your excitement.

Your father might have given you a warning when he saw you spending time \nwith some bad kids: “Remember, you become like your friends.” One of Goethe’s maxims captures it \nbetter: “Tell me with whom you consort and I will tell you who you are.” \nConsciously consider whom you allow into your life—not like some snobby elitist but like someone \nwho is trying to cultivate the best life possible. Ask yourself about the people you meet and spend time \nwith: Are they making me better? Do they encourage me to push forward and hold me accountable? Or \ndo they drag me down to their level? Now, with this in mind, ask the most important question: Should I \nspend more or less time with these folks? \nThe second part of Goethe’s quote tells us the stakes of this choice: “If I know how you spend your \ntime,” he said, “then I know what might become of you.”\n", "69": "\n  \nMarch 10th \nFIND YOURSELF A CATO \n  \n“We can remove most sins if we have a witness standing by as we are about to go wrong.

The economist Adam \nSmith had a similar concept, which he called the indifferent spectator. It doesn’t have to be an actual \nperson, just someone who, like Seneca said, can stand witness to our behavior. Someone who can quietly \nadmonish us if we are considering doing something lazy, dishonest, or selfish. \nAnd if we do it right, and live our lives in such a way, perhaps we can serve as someone else’s Cato \nor indifferent spectator when they need it.\n", "70": "\n  \nMarch 11th \nLIVING WITHOUT RESTRICTION \n  \n“The unrestricted person, who has in hand what they will in all events, is free.

Their work demands they wear a suit. Their success depends on attending certain \nparties, kissing up to people they don’t like. It will require—inevitably—realizing they are unable to say \nwhat they actually think. Worse, it demands that they become a different type of person or do bad things. \nSure, it might pay well—but they haven’ t truly examined the transaction.

For you may yourself have the same notions of good and evil, or similar ones, in which \ncase you'll make an allowance for what they’ve done. But if you no longer hold the same \nnotions, you’ll be more readily gracious for their error.” \n—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 7.26 \nS ocrates, perhaps the wisest person to ever live, used to say that “nobody does wrong willingly.” \nMeaning that no one is wrong on purpose either. Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are. \nThey think they’re right, they’re just mistaken. Otherwise, they wouldn’t think it anymore! \nCould it be that the slights you’ ve experienced or the harm that others have done to you was not \ninflicted intentionally? What if they simply thought they were doing the right thing—for them, even for \nyou? It’s like the memorial for Confederate soldiers at Arlington (obviously a cause that was wrongly \nfought for by people doing wrong), which states, in part, that the Confederate soldiers served “in simple \nobedience to duty, as they understood it.” Again—they understood wrongly, but it was their genuine \nunderstanding, just as Lincoln was genuine when he ended his famous Cooper Union speech by saying, \n“Let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.” \nHow much more tolerant and understanding would you be today if you could see the actions of other \npeople as attempts to do the right thing?

We also \nforget that we’re not the only people who matter and that our loss might be someone else’s gain. \nThis sense of being wronged is a simple awareness problem. We need to remember that all things are \nguided by reason—but that it is a vast and universal reason that we cannot always see.

In this sense, ego and self-deception are the \nenemies of the things we wish to have because we delude ourselves into believing that we already \npossess them. \nSo we must meet ego with the hostility and contempt that it insidiously deploys against us—to keep it \naway, if only for twenty-four hours at a time.\n", "74": "\n  \nMarch 15th \nTHE PRESENT IS ALL WE POSSESS \n  \n“Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multiple of that, keep in mind that no \none ever loses a life other than the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the \none they are losing.

And \nyet, almost to a person, they were wrong—and wrong to the tune of global market havoc. \nIt’s not hard to look at that situation and understand that greed was some part of the problem. Greed \nwas what led people to create complex markets that no one understood in the hope of making a quick \nbuck. Greed caused other people to make trades on strange pools of debt.

The harder I work, the more of it I seem to \nhave.” (That saying has been incorrectly attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who said nothing of the kind.) \nToday, we say, “Luck is where hard work meets opportunity.” Or is it typically flipped? \nToday, you can hope that good fortune and good luck magically come your way.

This is true \nno matter how spoiled and nice their life might be. \nThe same is true for humans. When you hear the Stoics brush aside certain emotions or material \nluxuries, it’s not because they don’t enjoy them. It’s not because the Stoic life is one bereft of happiness or \nfun.

When \na technical glitch erases our work, our reverse clause is that we can start fresh and do it better this time. \nOur progress can be impeded or disrupted, but the mind can always be changed—it retains the power to \nredirect the path. \nPart of this is remembering the usual course of things—Murphy’s Law states that “if anything can go \nwrong, it will.” So we keep this reverse clause handy because we know we’re probably going to have to \nuse it.

One day Cato witnessed a fine oration from Carneades, a Skeptic philosopher, \nwho waxed poetically on the importance of justice. Yet the next day Cato found Carneades arguing \npassionately about the problems with justice—that it was merely a device invented by society to create \norder. Cato was aghast at this kind of “philosopher,” who treated such a precious topic like a debate \nwhere one would argue both sides of an issue purely for show.

Just a year or so after writing this letter, he was \nfalsely accused of plotting against Nero. The price? Seneca was sentenced to commit suicide. As the \nhistorian Tacitus relates the scene, Seneca’s closest friends wept and protested the verdict. “Where,” \nSeneca asked them repeatedly, “are your maxims of philosophy, or the preparations of so many years’ \nstudy against evils to come?

As human beings we all breathe the atoms that \nmade up our ancestors and flow into the same earth when we die. \nOver and over again, the Stoics reminded themselves of the interconnectedness of life. Perhaps that \nwas because life in Greece and Rome was particularly harsh. Animals and people were slaughtered \nsenselessly to amuse the masses in the Colosseum (events lamented in the Stoic writings).

Just because something is \ngood for you definitely doesn’t mean it’s good for everyone. Think of the hedge fund managers who bet \nmassively against the economy—they profited by rooting for essentially everyone and everything else to \nfail. Is that who you want to be?

You can seek to understand who they are, what they need, and what forces or impulses might \nbe acting on them. And you can treat them well and be better off for it. \nThe same is true with the second person you encounter, and the third. Of course, there is no guarantee \nthat they will return the favor, but that’s not our concern.

Ultimately that’s what Stoicism is about—not judging other people’s behavior, but judging our \nOwn. \nWe’ ve all been a frenemy at one point or another. We’ve been nice to their face—usually because \nthere was something in it for us—but later, in different company, we said how we really felt.

There is a lot of evidence that Seneca was, \nin fact, a positive moral influence on the deranged young man, but even at the time, Seneca’s \ncontemporaries found it strange that a philosopher would serve as the right hand to such an evil person. \nThey even used the Greek word tyrannodidaskalos—tyrant teacher—to describe him. And just as \nShakespeare observed in Macbeth, “Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return / To plague \nth’inventor,” Seneca’s collaboration with Nero ultimately ended with the student murdering the teacher. \nIt’s something to think about when you consider whom to work with and whom to do business with in \nlife. If you show a client how to do something unethical or illegal, might they return the favor to an \nunsuspecting you later on? If you provide a bad example to your employees, to your associates, to your \nchildren, might they betray you or hurt you down the road?

Alexander would tell them, writes Seneca, that he hadn’t come all the way \nto Asia to accept whatever they would give him, but instead they were going to have to accept whatever \nhe chose to leave them. \nAccording to Seneca, we should treat philosophy the same way in our lives. Philosophy shouldn’t \nhave to accept what time or energy is left over from other occupations but instead we should graciously \nmake time for those other pursuits only once our study is finished. \nIf real self-improvement is what we’re after, why do we leave our reading until those few minutes \nbefore we shut off the lights and go to bed? Why do we block off eight to ten hours in the middle of the \nday to be at the office or to go to meetings but block out no time for thinking about the big questions?

Instead of simply accepting what happens, they \nurge us to actually enjoy what has happened—whatever it is. Nietzsche, many centuries later, coined the \nperfect expression to capture this idea: amor fati (a love of fate). It’s not just accepting, it’s loving \neverything that happens. \nTo wish for what has happened to happen is a clever way to avoid disappointment because nothing is \ncontrary to your desires.

How long we keep them is \nnot in our control. \nAs Epictetus realized some two thousand years before de Mello, our attachments are what make it so \nhard to accept change. Once we have them, we don’t want to let go. We become slaves to maintaining the \nStatus quo. We are like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland—running faster and faster to stay in the \nsame place. \nBut everything is in a constant state of change. We have certain things for a while and then lose them. \nThe only permanent thing is prohairesis, our capacity for reasoned choice.

If you find that discussing politics at the dinner table leads to fighting, why do you \nkeep bringing it up? If your sibling’s life choices bother you, why don’t you stop picking at them and \nmaking them your concern? The same goes for so many other sources of aggravation. \nIt’s not a sign of weakness to shut them out. Instead, it’s a sign of strong will.

To prove \nhe was mistaken, the king arranged to switch places with the courtier so he could experience what it \nwas like to be a king. The king made one other adjustment: he hung a sword by a hair over the throne to \nillustrate the peril and burden of kingship as well as the constant fear of assassination. We call that \ndangling reminder of death and difficulty the Sword of Damocles. \nThe reality is that a similar sword hangs over all of us—life can be taken from us at any moment. And \nthat threat can send us in one of two directions: we can fear and dread it, or we can use it to motivate us. \nTo do good, to be good. Because the sword is dangling, and there’s nothing else to be concerned with. \nWould you rather it catch you in the middle of some shameful, selfish act? Would you rather it catch you \nwaiting to be good in the future?\n", "341": "\n  \nDecember 7th \nTHE CARDS WE’RE DEALT \n  \n“Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what’s left as a bonus \nand live it according to Nature.

Because it gives us clarity. \nIf you were suddenly told you had but a week to live, what changes would you make? If you died but \nwere resuscitated, how different would your perspective be? \nWhen, as Shakespeare’s Prospero puts it, “every third thought shall be my grave,” there’s no risk of \ngetting caught up in petty matters or distractions.

However kind, these gestures are misguided. \nThe Stoics are stereotyped as suppressing their emotions, but their philosophy was actually intended \nto teach us to face, process, and deal with emotions immediately instead of running from them. Tempting \nas it is to deceive yourself or hide from a powerful emotion like grief—by telling yourself and other \npeople that you’re fine—awareness and understanding are better. Distraction might be pleasant in the \nshort term—by going to gladiatorial games, as a Roman might have done, for example. Focusing is better \nin the long term. \nThat means facing it now. Process and parse what you are feeling. Remove your expectations, your \nentitlements, your sense of having been wronged.

He later claimed to be a war hero. It was one \nof his most shameful lies. \nWe do not need to disregard our physical safety or engage in wanton acts of violence to be brave. But \nnobody respects a coward. Nobody likes a shirker of duty. Nobody admires a person who puts too high a \nprice on their own comfort and needs. \nThat’s the irony of cowardice.

If you let it carry through from morning to night and touch every part of \nyour life?\n", "364": "\n  \nDecember 30th \nTAKING THE BITE OUT OFIT \n  \n“To bear trials with a calm mind \nrobs misfortune of its strength and burden.” \n—SENECA, HERCULES OETAEUS, 231-232 \nhe people you admire, the ones who seem to be able to successfully handle and deal with adversity \nand difficulty, what do they have in common? Their sense of equilibrium, their orderly discipline. On \nthe one-yard line, in the midst of criticism, after a heartbreaking tragedy, during a stressful period, they \nkeep going. \nNot because they’re better than you. Not because they’re smarter. But because they have learned a \nlittle secret. You can take the bite out of any tough situation by bringing a calm mind to it. By considering \nit and meditating on it in advance. \nAnd this is true not just for our day-to-day adversities but for the greatest and most unavoidable trial \nof all: our own eventual death. It could come tomorrow, it could come in forty years. It could be quick and \npainless, or it could be excruciating. Our greatest asset in that ordeal will not be religion, it will not even \nbe the wise words of the philosophers. It will be, simply, our calm and reasoned mind.\n", "365": "\n  \nDecember 31st \nGET ACTIVE IN YOUR OWN RESCUE \n  \n“Stop wandering about! You aren’t likely to read your own notebooks, or ancient histories, or the \nanthologies you’ve collected to enjoy in your old age. Get busy with life’s purpose, toss aside \nempty hopes, get active in your own rescue—if you care for yourself at all—and do it while you \ncan.” \n—MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 3.14 \nhe purpose of all our reading and studying is to aid us in the pursuit of the good life (and death). At \nsome point, we must put our books aside and take action. So that, as Seneca put it, the “words \nbecome works.” There is an old saying that a “scholar made is a soldier spoiled.” We want to be both \nscholars and soldiers—soldiers in the good fight. \nThat’s what’s next for you. Move forward, move onward. Another book isn’t the answer. The right \nchoices and decisions are. Who knows how much time you have left, or what awaits us tomorrow?\n"}
